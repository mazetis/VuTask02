With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers. Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as \"the hacker ethic,\" that still thrives today. Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.",

  "description": "Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of 'recipes,' this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniquesTopics and features: Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.",

The popularity and marketsuccess of games is evident from both the increased earnings from games, over $7 Billion in2005, and from the fact that over 200 academic institutions worldwide now offer game relatedprograms of study.In view of the intense interest in computer games educators and trainers, in business, industry, thegovernment, and the military would like to use computer games to improve the delivery ofinstruction. Computer Games and Instruction is intended for these educators and trainers. Itreviews the research evidence supporting use of computer games, for instruction, and also reviews the history of games in general, ineducation, and by the military. In addition chapters examine gender differences in game use, and the implications of games for use bylower socio-economic students, for students' reading, and for contemporary theories of instruction.

Examples highlight the latest processor designs, benchmarking standards, languages and tools. As with previous editions, a MIPs processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies at work in a computer system. The book presents an entire MIPS instruction set-instruction by instruction-the fundamentals of assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. A new aspect of the third edition is the explicit connection between program performance and CPU performance. The authors show how hardware and software components--such as the specific algorithm, programming language, compiler, ISA and processor implementation--impact program performance. Throughout the book a new feature focusing on program performance describes how to search for bottlenecks and improve performance in various parts of the system. The book digs deeper into the hardware/software interface, presenting a complete view of the function of the programming language and compiler--crucial for understanding computer organization. A CD provides a toolkit of simulators and compilers along with tutorials for using them. For instructor resources click on the grey \"companion site\" button found on the right side of this page.

  "description": "Future computing professionals must become familiar with historical computer architectures because many of the same or similar techniques are still being used and may persist well into the future. Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer Design discusses the fundamental principles of computer design and performance enhancement that have proven effective and demonstrates how current trends in architecture and implementation rely on these principles while expanding upon them or applying them in new ways. Rather than focusing on a particular type of machine, this textbook explains concepts and techniques via examples drawn from various architectures and implementations. When necessary, the author creates simplified examples that clearly explain architectural and implementation features used across many computing platforms. Following an introduction that discusses the difference between architecture and implementation and how they relate, the next four chapters cover the architecture of traditional, single-processor systems that are still, after 60 years, the most widely used computing machines. The final two chapters explore approaches to adopt when single-processor systems do not reach desired levels of performance or are not suited for intended applications. Topics include parallel systems, major classifications of architectures, and characteristics of unconventional systems of the past, present, and future. This textbook provides students with a thorough grounding in what constitutes high performance and how to measure it, as well as a full familiarity in the fundamentals needed to make systems perform better. This knowledge enables them to understand and evaluate the many new systems they will encounter throughout their professional careers.",

  "description": "In the last 15 years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer hardware and software is now available and can support the complex high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled are now able to live for many years and even those with severely limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic means of communication and control because of the recent advances in the technology, research, and applications of BCI. This book is intended to provide an introduction to and summary of essentially all major aspects of BCI research and development. Its goal is to be a comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated presentation of the field's key principles, current practice, and future prospects.",

It is written for undergraduate science and engineering students who have taken a first course in differential and integral calculus. The approach is to ensure conceptual understanding of the numerical methods by relying on students geometric intuition. The book provides coverage of iterative methods for solving algebraic and transcendental equations, direct and iterative methods of solving simultaneous algebraic equations, numerical methods for differen-tiation and integration, and solution of ordinary differential equations with initial conditions. The formulation of algorithms is illustrated with a number of solved examples and an algorithmic language based on English (and similar to PASCAL) is used to express the logic of the numerical procedures. This approach is thus different from that used in most books which either use a programming language like FORTRAN or use flow charts to express algorithms. The solutions to selected problems have been provided at the end of the book.",

  "description": "This is a book about the computer revolution of the mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible. Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer specialists--programmers, systems analysts, and other software developers--who transformed the electronic computer from a scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series of critiques of the social and organizational impact of electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed the \"computer boys\" were taking over, not just in the corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society in general. In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and women (a surprising number of the \"computer boys\" were, in fact, female) who built their careers around the novel technology of electronic computing explores issues of power, identity, and expertise that have only become more significant in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally human development.",

Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization.

  "description": "Until recently, almost all of the interactions between objects in virtual 3D worlds have been based on calculations performed using linear algebra. Linear algebra relies heavily on coordinates, however, which can make many geometric programming tasks very specific and complex-often a lot of effort is required to bring about even modest performance enhancements. Although linear algebra is an efficient way to specify low-level computations, it is not a suitable high-level language for geometric programming. Geometric Algebra for Computer Science presents a compelling alternative to the limitations of linear algebra. Geometric algebra, or GA, is a compact, time-effective, and performance-enhancing way to represent the geometry of 3D objects in computer programs. In this book you will find an introduction to GA that will give you a strong grasp of its relationship to linear algebra and its significance for your work. You will learn how to use GA to represent objects and perform geometric operations on them. And you will begin mastering proven techniques for making GA an integral part of your applications in a way that simplifies your code without slowing it down. * The first book on Geometric Algebra for programmers in computer graphics and entertainment computing * Written by leaders in the field providing essential information on this new technique for 3D graphics * This full colour book includes a website with GAViewer, a program to experiment with GA",

  "description": "Computer and Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities (previously entitled Machine Vision) clearly and systematically presents the basic methodology of computer and machine vision, covering the essential elements of the theory while emphasizing algorithmic and practical design constraints. This fully revised fourth edition has brought in more of the concepts and applications of computer vision, making it a very comprehensive and up-to-date tutorial text suitable for graduate students, researchers and R&D engineers working in this vibrant subject. Key features include: Practical examples and case studies give the 'ins and outs' of developing real-world vision systems, giving engineers the realities of implementing the principles in practice. New chapters containing case studies on surveillance and driver assistance systems give practical methods on these cutting-edge applications in computer vision. Necessary mathematics and essential theory are made approachable by careful explanations and well-illustrated examples. Updated content and new sections cover topics such as human iris location, image stitching, line detection using RANSAC, performance measures, and hyperspectral imaging. The 'recent developments' section now included in each chapter will be useful in bringing students and practitioners up to date with the subject. Roy Davies is Emeritus Professor of Machine Vision at Royal Holloway, University of London. He has worked on many aspects of vision, from feature detection to robust, real-time implementations of practical vision tasks. His interests include automated visual inspection, surveillance, vehicle guidance and crime detection. He has published more than 200 papers, and three books - Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities (1990), Electronics, Noise and Signal Recovery (1993), and Image Processing for the Food Industry (2000); the first of these has been widely used internationally for more than 20 years, and is now out in this much enhanced fourth edition.

  "description": "A basic problem in computer vision is to understand the structure of a real world scene given several images of it. Techniques for solving this problem are taken from projective geometry and photogrammetry. Here, the authors cover the geometric principles and their algebraic representation in terms of camera projection matrices, the fundamental matrix and the trifocal tensor. The theory and methods of computation of these entities are discussed with real examples, as is their use in the reconstruction of scenes from multiple images. The new edition features an extended introduction covering the key ideas in the book (which itself has been updated with additional examples and appendices) and significant new results which have appeared since the first edition. Comprehensive background material is provided, so readers familiar with linear algebra and basic numerical methods can understand the projective geometry and estimation algorithms presented, and implement the algorithms directly from the book.",

  "description": "This monograph by one of the world's leading vision researchers provides a thorough,mathematically rigorous exposition of a broad and vital area in computer vision: the problems andtechniques related to three-dimensional (stereo) vision and motion. The emphasis is on usinggeometry to solve problems in stereo and motion, with examples from navigation and objectrecognition.Faugeras takes up such important problems in computer vision as projective geometry,camera calibration, edge detection, stereo vision (with many examples on real images), differentkinds of representations and transformations (especially 3-D rotations), uncertainty and methods ofaddressing it, and object representation and recognition. His theoretical account is illustratedwith the results of actual working programs.Three-Dimensional Computer Vision proposes solutions toproblems arising from a specific robotics scenario in which a system must perceive and act. Movingabout an unknown environment, the system has to avoid static and mobile obstacles, build models ofobjects and places in order to be able to recognize and locate them, and characterize its own motionand that of moving objects, by providing descriptions of the corresponding three-dimensionalmotions. The ideas generated, however, can be used indifferent settings, resulting in a general bookon computer vision that reveals the fascinating relationship of three-dimensional geometry and theimaging process.Olivier Faugeras is Research Director of the Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratoryat INRIA Sophia-Antipolis and a Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique inParis.",

The unparalleled rate of technological advancement, the explosion of computer applications, and the now-in-progress migration to a wireless world have made it difficult for engineers to keep up with all the developments in specialties outside their own. References published only a few years ago are now sorely out of date. The Computer Engineering Handbook changes all of that. Under the leadership of Vojin Oklobdzija and a stellar editorial board, some of the industry's foremost experts have joined forces to create what promises to be the definitive resource for computer design and engineering. Instead of focusing on basic, introductory material, it forms a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the field's most recent achievements, outstanding issues, and future directions. The world of computer engineering is vast and evolving so rapidly that what is cutting-edge today may be obsolete in a few months. While exploring the new developments, trends, and future directions of the field, The Computer Engineering Handbook captures what is fundamental and of lasting value.",

  "description": "This book introduces Computer Programming to a beginner, using Fortran 90 and its recent extension Fortran 95. While Fortran 77 has been used for many years and is currently very popular, computer scientists have been seriously concerned about good programming practice to promote development of reliable programs. Thus, the International Standards Organization set up a group to 'modernise' Fortran and introduce new features which have made languages such as Pascal and C popular. The committee took over a decade to come up with the new standard, Fortran 90. Fortran 90 has introduced many new features in Fortran, such as recursion, pointers, user-defined data types etc., which were hitherto available only in languages such as Pascal and C. Fortran 90 is not an evolutionary change of Fortran 77 but is drastically different. Though Fortran 77 programs can be run using a Fortran 90 compiler, Fortran 90 is so different that the author felt it was not a good idea to just revise Fortran 77 and introduce Fortran 90 in some places in the book. Thus this book is entirely new and introduces Fortran 90 from basics. In 1996 some small extensions were made to Fortran 90 and has called Fortran 95. This book also discusses these features. As all new programs in Fortran will henceforth be written in Fortran 90, it is essential for students to learn this language.The methodology of presentation, however, closely follows the one used by the author in his popular book on Fortran 77.",

It is designed to cover the requirements of a first-course in computer organization for undergraduate Computer Science, Electronics, or MCA students. Beginning from first principles, the text guides students through to a stage where they are able to design and build a small computer with available IC chips. Starting with the foundation material on data representation, computer arithmetic and combinatorial and sequential circuit design, the text explains ALU design and includes a discussion on an ALU IC chip. It also discusses Algorithmic State Machine and its representation using a Hardware Description Language before shifting to computer organization. The evolutionary development of a small hypothetical computer is described illustrating hardware-software trade-off in computer organization. Its instruction set is designed giving reasons why each new instruction is introduced. This is followed by a description of the general features of a CPU, organization of main memory and I/O systems.

  "description": "The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) recently endorsed the use of computers in food science education. The minimum standards for degrees in food science, as suggested by IFT,\"require the students to use computers in the solution of problems, the collection and analysis of data, the control processes, in addition to word processing.\"Because they are widely used in business, allow statistical and graphical of experimental data, and can mimic laboratory experimentation, spreadsheets provide an ideal tool for learning the important features of computers and programming. In addition, they are ideally suited for food science students, who usually do not have an extensive mathematical background. Drawing from the many courses he has taught at UC Davis, Dr. Singh covers the general basics of spreadsheets using examples specific to food science. He includes more than 50 solved problems drawn from key areas of food science, namely food microbiology, food chemistry, sensory evaluation, statistical quality control, and food engineering. Each problem is presented with the required equations and detailed steps necessary for programming the spreadsheet. Helpful hints in using the spreadsheets are also provided throughout the text. Key Features * The first book to integrate speadsheets in teaching food science and technology * Includes more than 50 solved examples of spreadsheet use in food science and engineering * Presents a step-by-step introduction to spreadsheet use * Provides a food composition database on a computer disk",

  "description": "Arithmetic and Logic in Computer Systems provides a useful guide to a fundamental subject of computer science and engineering. Algorithms for performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in digital computer systems are presented, with the goal of explaining the concepts behind the algorithms, rather than addressing any direct applications. Alternative methods are examined, and explanations are supplied of the fundamental materials and reasoning behind theories and examples. No other current books deal with this subject, and the author is a leading authority in the field of computer arithmetic. The text introduces the Conventional Radix Number System and the Signed-Digit Number System, as well as Residue Number System and Logarithmic Number System. This book serves as an essential, up-to-date guide for students of electrical engineering and computer and mathematical sciences, as well as practicing engineers and computer scientists involved in the design, application, and development of computer arithmetic units.",

  "description": "Data mining is becoming a pervasive technology in activities as diverse as using historical data to predict the success of a marketing campaign, looking for patterns in financial transactions to discover illegal activities or analyzing genome sequences. From this perspective, it was just a matter of time for the discipline to reach the important area of computer security. Applications Of Data Mining In Computer Security presents a collection of research efforts on the use of data mining in computer security. Data mining has been loosely defined as the process of extracting information from large amounts of data. In the context of security, the information we are seeking is the knowledge of whether a security breach has been experienced, and if the answer is yes, who is the perpetrator. This information could be collected in the context of discovering intrusions that aim to breach the privacy of services, data in a computer system or alternatively, in the context of discovering evidence left in a computer system as part of criminal activity. Applications Of Data Mining In Computer Security concentrates heavily on the use of data mining in the area of intrusion detection. The reason for this is twofold. First, the volume of data dealing with both network and host activity is so large that it makes it an ideal candidate for using data mining techniques. Second, intrusion detection is an extremely critical activity. This book also addresses the application of data mining to computer forensics. This is a crucial area that seeks to address the needs of law enforcement in analyzing the digital evidence. Applications Of Data Mining In Computer Security is designed to meet the needs of a professional audience composed of researchers and practitioners in industry and graduate level students in computer science.",

Today, one can say that any attempt to facilitate the relationship between the machine and the user must consider not only the technological perspective (e.g., promote the usability) but also, for instance, the way the user is going to use the technology and his or her purpose as well as the social and cultural context of this use (the Human and the Computer).",

Check out the boxed set that brings together Volumes 1 - 4A in one elegant case, and offers the purchaser a $50 discount off the price of buying the four volumes individually. The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set, 3/e ISBN: 0321751043 Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4, Fascicle 4,The: Generating All Trees--History of Combinatorial Generation: Generating All Trees--History of Combinatorial Generation This multivolume work on the analysis of algorithms has long been recognized as the definitive description of classical computer science.The three complete volumes published to date already comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth's writings. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his \u201ccookbook\u201d solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books. To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which will be published at regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete. Volume 4, Fascicle 4 This latest fascicle covers the generation of all trees, a basic topic that has surprisingly rich ties to the first three volumes of The Art of Computer Programming. In thoroughly discussing this well-known subject, while providing 124 new exercises, Knuth continues to build a firm foundation for programming. To that same end, this fascicle also covers the history of combinatorial generation. Spanning many centuries, across many parts of the world, Knuth tells a fascinating story of interest and relevance to every artful programmer, much of it never before told. The story even includes a touch of suspense: two problems that no one has yet been able to solve.",

Though a new title, it is a completely revised and fully updated version of the author's earlier book Data Communications. The rapid strides made during the last decade in the fields of data communication and networking, and the close link between these two subjects have prompted the author to add several chapters on computer networks in this text. The book gives a masterly analysis of topics ranging from the principles of data transmission to computer networking applications. It also provides standard protocols, thereby enabling to bridge the gap between theory and practice. What's more, it correlates the network protocols to the concepts, which are explained with the help of numerous examples to facilitate students' understanding of the subject. This well-organized text presents the latest developments in the field and details current topics of interest such as Multicasting, MPLS, IPv6, Gigabit Ethernets, IPSec, SSL, Auto-negotiation, Wireless LANs, Network security, Differentiated services, and ADSL.

  "description": "Annotation \"This book comes right on time ... It is amazing so early in a new field that a book appears which connects theory to algorithms and through them to convincing applications ... This book will surely be with us for quite some time to come.\" From the foreword by Arnold Smeulders The goal of this book is to address the use of several important machine learning techniques into computer vision applications. An innovative combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques has the promise of advancing the field of computer vision, which contributes to better understanding of complex real-world applications. The effective usage of machine learning technology in real-world computer vision problems requires understanding the domain of application, abstraction of a learning problem from a given computer vision task, and the selection of appropriate representations for the learnable (input) and learned (internal) entities of the system. In this book, we address all these important aspects from a new perspective: that the key element in the current computer revolution is the use of machine learning to capture the variations in visual appearance, rather than having the designer of the model accomplish this. As a bonus, models learned from large datasets are likely to be more robust and more realistic than the brittle all-design models. This book is intended for computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition researchers as well as for graduate students in computer science and electrical engineering.",

Through a steady stream of experimental research, tool-building efforts, and theoretical studies, the design of an instruction-set architecture has been transformed into one of the most quantitative branches of computer technology. However, this explosive growth has led to unprecedented harware complexity and almost intolerable development costs. The challenge faxing current and future computer designers is to institute simplicity where we now have complexity; to use fundamental theories being developed in this area to gain performance and ease-of-use benefits from simpler circuits; to understand the interplay between technological capabilities/limitations and sound architectural decisions. Computer arithmetic plays a key role in the computer designers' quest for user-friendliness, compactness, simplicity, high performance, low cost, and low power.

Although there are many recent developments, until now there was no one source that reviewed the latest methods of automated scoring for complex assessments. This is the first volume to provide that coverage, along with examples of \"best practices\" in the design, implementation, and evaluation of automated complex assessment. The contributing authors, all noted leaders in the field, introduce each method in the context of actual applications in real assessments so as to provide an accessible, realistic view of current industry practices. Evidence Centered Design, an innovative approach to assessment design, is used as the book's conceptual framework, to provide a common perspective from which to compare and contrast each method introduced. The chapters review both well known methods for automated scoring such as rule-based logic, regression-based, and IRT systems, as well as more recent procedures such as Bayesian and neural networks. The concluding chapters compare and contrast the various methods and provide a vision for the future. Each chapter features a discussion of the philosophical and practical approaches of the method, the associated implications for validity, reliability, and implementation, and the calculations and processes of each technique. Intended for researchers, practitioners, and advanced students in educational testing and measurement, psychometrics, cognitive science, technical training and assessment, diagnostic, licensing, and certification exams, and expert systems, the book also serves as a resource in advanced courses in educational measurement or psychometrics.",

A vast array of companies devoted to defending computers from hackers and viruses have cropped up. Research and academic institutions devote a considerable amount of time and effort to the study of information systems and computer security. Anyone with access to a computer needs to be aware of the developing trends and growth of computer security. To that end, this book presents a comprehensive and carefully selected bibliography of the literature most relevant to understanding computer security. Following the bibliography section, continued access is provided via author, title, and subject indexes. With such a format, this book serves as an important guide and reference tool in the defence of our computerised culture.",

  "description": "Tiling theory is an elegant branch of mathematics that has applications in several areas of computer science. The most immediate application area is graphics, where tiling theory has been used in the contexts of texture generation, sampling theory, remeshing, and of course the generation of decorative patterns. The combination of a solid theoretical base (complete with tantalizing open problems), practical algorithmic techniques, and exciting applications make tiling theory a worthwhile area of study for practitioners and students in computer science. This synthesis lecture introduces the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of tiling theory to a computer graphics audience. The goal is primarily to introduce concepts and terminology, clear up common misconceptions, and state and apply important results. The book also describes some of the algorithms and data structures that allow several aspects of tiling theory to be used in practice.

It covers a representative set of novel graph-theoretic methods for complex computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. The first part of the book presents the application of graph theory to low-level processing of digital images such as a new method for partitioning a given image into a hierarchy of homogeneous areas using graph pyramids, or a study of the relationship between graph theory and digital topology. Part II presents graph-theoretic learning algorithms for high-level computer vision and pattern recognition applications, including a survey of graph based methodologies for pattern recognition and computer vision, a presentation of a series of computationally efficient algorithms for testing graph isomorphism and related graph matching tasks in pattern recognition and a new graph distance measure to be used for solving graph matching problems. Finally, Part III provides detailed descriptions of several applications of graph-based methods to real-world pattern recognition tasks. It includes a critical review of the main graph-based and structural methods for fingerprint classification, a new method to visualize time series of graphs, and potential applications in computer network monitoring and abnormal event detection.",

  "description": "Any choice with a significant impact on the environment should, in principle, be the outcome of a political process reflecting the social preferences of everyone involved. Unfortunately, this ideal procedure requires a level of time and money that does not justify its application for planning each specific intervention. Different methods, mainly derived from traditional investment analyses, have been proposed for providing a rational basis for environmental decisions that cannot be analysed through a public debate. These methods have proved inadequate, however, and are being replaced by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a less formal, but more applicable, method of incorporating environmental considerations in the decision process. Though the interpretation of EIA differs among various national and regional laws, it is now widely accepted as a potentially useful aid and is becoming a routine procedure for environmental planning and management in many countries. Computers can help to make EIA as explicit and repeatable as possible by supplying tools supporting its various phases.This book addresses topics such as the use of databases and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in the first screening phase, the development of mathematical models or expert systems to predict the impacts, and the use of multicriteria methodologies to support the final choice. Actual implementations of integrated computer systems that can be used throughout the decision process are also described.",

This timely publication highlights four main themes that define current issues, technical advances and applications of computer-based testing: Advances in computer-based testing -- new test designs, item selection algorithms, exposure control issues and methods, and new tests that capitalize on the power of computer technology. Operational issues -- systems design, test security, and legal and ethical matters. New and improved uses -- for tests in employment and credentialing. The future of computer-based testing -- identifying potential issues, developments, major advances and problems to overcome. Written by internationally recognized contributors, each chapter focuses on issues of control, quality, security and technology. These issues provide the basic structure for the International Test Commission's new Guidelines on Computer-Based Testing and Testing on the Internet. The contributions to this book have played a key role in the development of these guidelines. Computer-Based Testing and the Internet is a comprehensive guide for all professionals, academics and practitioners working in the fields of education, credentialing, personnel testing and organizational assessment. It will also be of value to students developing expertise in these areas.",

  "description": "The computer as calculating aide, as military wonder weapon, as electronic data processor that rationalises workplaces, as plaything & partner, as the tool for creativity & communication, as a memory & intelligence booster, & finally as a super- or hyper-medium - the computer has been accorded all of these roles & claims during its brief history. Its potential as a universally configurable machine & tool for other tools appears unfathomable. Yet precisely this versatility & the enormous variety of its allotted tasks & functions emphasise the necessity of tapping them & being using them purposefully & effectively, which makes ease of use the key criterion of a computer. The interface between the computer & the human being is not simply a kind of space, surface or point for interacting with the computer, but also the locus where the two historical dimensions of its usage, programming & applications, grew closer & closer until they finally merged. This publication will be the first book ever to tackle the history of this interface - from the perspective of both the computer & the design. A detailed text & a wealth of illustrations forge the appropriate link between art & technology. The work can be used as a scientific reference book, but equally enjoyed as a book on design & photography, & its layout & structure will do justice to both these purposes. With its approximately one thousand illustrations, the book not only describes the constantly altering concepts & situations for that determine computer use; it also serves as a precise & vivid record of people's continuously changing surroundings in their working & private lives, whilst simultaneously highlighting the design, fashion & photography of their times...",

  "description": "Considering computer contracting? If you are, then read this book. It explores the many aspects of the computer contracting world and gives sound practical advice to both the newcomer and the experienced contractor. It will also be invaluable if you are an employer wrestling with the perennial problem of finding staff in this highly competitive marketplace.

The author, a freelancer himself, considers what it takes to become a contract worker and gives you invaluable information throughout to help you get started in the world of computer contracting. This book looks at: * why contract workers are used at all - what kind of companies actually employ contractors, and why? * how you make the transition from full-time working - what does it actually take temperamentally to be a successful contractor? * how you start - what does forming your own company involve, and why is it even necessary? * how you go about finding a contract, and negotiating the right rate. * what agencies do for you - and how can you find who are the best? * the financial differences between being a full-time employee and a contractor - how do you manage your affairs? * how you keep your experience up to date when you do not have a regular employer to help train you. * what sort of opportunities are available, and what sort of rates of pay you can expect. * your possible career progressions after contracting. The contracting scene is ever changing. In this wide-ranging book, the current outlook for contract staff is analysed as well as the trends in the computer industry which are driving these changes. Some doors are opening whilst other close - let this book be your guide. If you have marketable skills, the right attitude and would like to be your own boss, there could not be a better time to consider computer contracting.",
